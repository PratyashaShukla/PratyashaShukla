### Hi there 👋

🚀 Welcome to my cosmic codebase! I'm Pratyasha, a passionate developer exploring the boundless universe of programming.

💡 My mind orbits around Programming. I'm like an interstellar traveler, seeking out new challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

🌌 When I'm not busy crafting elegant code, you can find me stargazing 🌠, pondering the mysteries of the universe, or lost in the pages of a mind-bending sci-fi novel 📚.

🛠️ I'm a firm believer in the power of open-source. My mission is to contribute to projects that make a positive impact on our digital cosmos and inspire other developers to reach for the stars.

🌱 Currently cultivating my skills in Competitive coding, I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge and excite me.

🪐 Let's embark on this coding odyssey together! Explore my constellation of repositories, and feel free to shoot me a comet 🌠 if you want to discuss tech, share ideas, or just geek out!

May the code be with you! 🖖
